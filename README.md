This Repo was created for adding custom config files.

The files are not only specific to my workflow so others may benefit from them .
Main reason is that by daily working there were som configs and other setups which i needed to do so often.
So i will be storing those files here and me and other will benefit from them.

# The structure :

-   For specific programms or tools there is a specific branch
-   All random programms and tools the files will be in master branch available
